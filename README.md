Example of a Sequential Keras model: the Pima Indians
Keras essentially offers two models of neural networks: the sequential one and the functional one. The sequential model is the simplest, and can be represented by a stack of layers. These will allow us to build the final neural network model layer by layer. To understand how a sequential model is created, we will use the classic example of predictive diabetes analysis in the Arizona Pima population.
The goal of this example is to make a prediction as to whether a person from the Pima Indians group has diabetes or is at risk of developing it.
